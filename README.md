# YDCP
WebDev Workshop [2023/2024]

# How to view the code using Github Pages:

Go to this website:
https://theqwertykeyboard.github.io/YDCP

Then type in the code name at the end of the website

eg to see 'Exercise1.html' (found under "Session 3 - Intro to HTML" Directory),
the website should be 'https://theqwertykeyboard.github.io/YDCP/Session 3 - Intro to HTML/Exercise1.html'

[this is meant to be for my reference if I forget how to do this]
