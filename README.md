# YDCP
WebDev Workshop [2023/2024]

# How to view the code using Github Pages:

Go to this website:
https://pravinrram.github.io/YDCP

Then type in the foolder and file name at the end of the website

eg to see 'Exercise1.html' (found under "Session-3_Intro-to-HTML" Directory),
the website should be 'https://pravinrram.github.io/YDCP/Session-3_Intro-to-HTML/Exercise1.html'

[this is meant to be for my reference if I forget how to do this]

=================================================

To see the website itself when there's CSS/Javascript involved, you only need to look up for the html file in your searchbar

eg to see 'Exercise4_html.html' (found under "Session-5_CSS-Fundamentals" Directory),
the website should be 'https://pravinrram.github.io/YDCP/Session-5_CSS-Fundamentals/Exercise4_html.html'
